Summer mood, hot sand under my feet
Cold beer, cheap wine
Yeah, that's all that we need
We got the moves, we got the moves
And everybody's like
"Oh, fuck yeah, let's do it again!"

We got the moves, we got the moves
And everybody's like
"Yesterday we drank too much, let's do it again!"
We got the groove, we got the groove
So everybody, put your hands straight up!
Tonight is the night!

We are young, we are free
Sipping on booze on a sunny beach
We'r–µ alive, we believe
That summertime memories
Will never fade away

We're living the good life, high life
Everybody wants that hot vibe
We wanna feel it just all over and over again
More, just give me more
'Cause we're addicted to the groove
Oh, yeah, we do it again!

We got the moves, we got the moves
And everybody's like
"Yesterday we drank too much, let's do it again!"
We got the groove, we got the groove
So everybody, put your hands straight up!
Tonight is the night!
