Summer mood, hot sand under my feet
Cold beer, cheap wine
Yeah, that's all that we need
We got the moves, we got the moves
And everybody's like
"Oh, fuck yeah, let's do it again!"

We got the moves, we got the moves
And everybody's like
"Yesterday we drank too much, let's do it again!"
We got the groove, we got the groove
So everybody, put your hands straight up!
Tonight is the night!

We are young, we are free
Sipping on booze on a sunny beach
We'rе alive, we believe
That summertime memories
Will never fade away

We're living the good life, high life
Everybody wants that hot vibe
We wanna feel it just all over and over again
More, just give me more
'Cause we're addicted to the groove
Oh, yeah, we do it again!

We got the moves, we got the moves
And everybody's like
"Yesterday we drank too much, let's do it again!"
We got the groove, we got the groove
So everybody, put your hands straight up!
Tonight is the night!

We are young, we are free
Sipping on booze on a sunny beach
We're alive, we believe
That summertime memories
Will never fade away
Will never fade away
Will never fade away

We don't need no club, all we need is the sun
Yeah, we will rave like hell 'til the weekend is done
We got the moves, we got the moves
And everybody, put your hands straight up!
Tonight is the night! We say

Döp-dödödö-döp
Döp-dödödö-döp
Döp-dödödö-döp
Döp-dödödö-döp
Döp-dödödö-döp
Döp-dödödö-döp
Döp-dödödö-döp
Döp-dödödö-döp
Döp-dödödö-döp
Döp-dödödö-döp

We got the moves, we got the moves
And everybody's like
"Yesterday we drank too much, let's do it again!"
We got the groove, we got the groove
So everybody, put your hands straight up!
Tonight is the night!

Everybody, hands up!
We don't need a damn club
Get down 'cause we're gonna party like hell
And we won't stop until the sun up
Hits our glowing eyes like, "Boom! Boom!"
We gon' put the track on repeat

We are young, we are free
Sipping on booze on a sunny beach
We're alive, we believe
That summertime memories...

We are young, we are free
Sipping on booze on a sunny beach
We're alive, we believe
That summertime memories
Will never fade away
Will never fade away
Will never fade away
